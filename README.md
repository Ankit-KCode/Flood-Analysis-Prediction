# Flood : Analysis & Prediction

This project aims to leverage data analysis and linear regression
techniques to analyze historical flood data and predict future
flood events. By identifying patterns and relationships in the
data, the project seeks to provide actionable insights for early
warning systems and disaster preparedness.




## ðŸ›  Skills
Jupyter Notebook, Python, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Visualisation.


## Features

- Flood Data Analysis

## ðŸ‘€ PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Flooding poses a severe threat to communities worldwide, leading to devastating consequences. Despite advancements in technology and meteorology, accurately predicting flood events remains challenging due to the complex interplay of various climatic and environmental factors.
- This project addresses the need for a more reliable and data-driven approach to flood prediction, focusing on linear regression to model and forecast flood occurrences based on historical data and relevant predictors.

### Steps ----

## 1. Data Collection
### Data Sources
The dataset used in
this project is taken
from Kaggle. There are
several attributes in
the data set on which
we are analyzing,
visualizing and
predicting the flood

### Data Description
This dataset contains information on various factors that may
influence flood risk. The dataset includes several features
representing environmental, social, infrastructure, and
governance-related factors that could impact the likelihood
and severity of flooding events.

## 2. Data Preprocessing
### Data Cleaning
For Data cleaning first we have
check null and duplicate values
present in dataset by
df.isna().sum() &
df.duplicated().sum() function.
remove the unusable
column by
df.drop('id',axis=1,inplace=True)
method
### Handling Missing Values
Missing values is replace by the
mean value of column
We have used method
df['MonsoonIntensity'].fillna(df['
MonsoonIntensity'].mean()) to
handle the missing values with
mean value.

## 3. Data Analysis
### Analytical Tools and Methods Used:
Python: For data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, seaborn and matplotlib.
### Insights Derived:
- Conduct EDA to uderstand the distribution and relationship between variables.
- Visualize data using charts, graphs, and heatmaps to identify patterns and trends.
### Key Findings
- Select significant features based on domain knowledge and Statistical test.
- Create new feature through, transformation and aggregation and interaction term.
